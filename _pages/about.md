<!-- Hello world! <i>Under construction</i> -->

I am postdoctoral researcher at [NAVLab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} at Stanford University working with [Prof. Grace Gao](https://navlab.stanford.edu/people){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. in Aerospace Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and my B.Tech. also in Aerospace Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Broadly speaking, I enjoy working on problems related to the field of robotics. My current research focuses on safe positioning and navigation of ground and aerial autonomous vehicles.
