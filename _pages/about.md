<!-- Hello world! <i>Under construction</i> -->

I am currently a Senior Autonomy Navigation Engineer at [Supernal](https://supernal.aero/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} working on building safe and certifiable autonomous flying vehicles for [advanced air mobility](https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Previously, I completed my postdoctoral research at [NAVLab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} at Stanford University after obtaining my Ph.D.[<i class="fas fa-fw fa-file-pdf zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/110464){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and M.S.[<i class="fas fa-fw fa-file-pdf zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/97501){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and my B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

Broadly speaking, I enjoy working on challenging problems in the field of robotics. My research interests include safe positioning and navigation of autonomous systems, focusing on learning-based algorithms, sensor fusion and trajectory planning.
