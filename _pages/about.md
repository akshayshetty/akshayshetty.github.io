<!-- Hello world! <i>Under construction</i> -->

I recently completed my postdoctoral research at [NAVLab](https://navlab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} at Stanford University working with [Prof. Grace Gao](https://navlab.stanford.edu/people){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I obtained my Ph.D.[<i class="fas fa-fw fa-file-pdf zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/110464){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and M.S.[<i class="fas fa-fw fa-file-pdf zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/97501){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and my B.Tech. also in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Broadly speaking, I enjoy working on problems in the field of robotics. My current research includes safe positioning and navigation of single and multi-agent autonomous systems, focusing on trajectory planning, sensor fusion and learning-based algorithms.
